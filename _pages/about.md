I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Cyber-Physical Life (CyPhy Life) Research Group](https://cyphy.life/), led by [Eduardo Castell√≥ Ferrer](https://eduardo.castello.phd/). My main responsibility is leading the [ROBOPRENEUR](https://cyphy.life/research-line/robopreneur/) research line,which explores how robotics and blockchain technologies can be combined to create autonomous, secure and explanable robotic systems capable of full economic independency. These robots are designed to complete tasks, receive compensation, and reinvest earnings toward their own sustainability. This research focuses on new forms of human-robot interaction, where robots are not only seen as tools but also as participants in economic systems. We investigate whether blockchain can serve as a foundation for physical artificial intelligence. In addition, I oversee the research activities within our lab, co-supervising the work of our team members. I am also actively involved in writing project proposals and securing funding to support ongoing and future research efforts in the lab. 

Until recently i was part of the [Inovation Hub](https://innova.laude.tech/) of [Laude Technology](https://laude.tech/en/home/), leading a team of reaserchers and working on R&D projects with Universities, Research Institutes and Industry. We research and apply advanced algorithms (AI, Machine Learning, optimization) to solve technological challenges of our clients. As part of my daily activities i lead national and European R&D projects, participate in obtaining financing for technological research projects and contribute to the development of high-impact scientific papers in the field of telecommunications and robotics.

In the past, i worked as Research Scientist at the [Telematic](https://www.uc3m.es/departamento-ingenieria-telematica/inicio) engineering department in UC3M on the NETCOM Research Group where i did my PhD and 2 years of postdoc with [Antonio de la Oliva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NV75GPcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Carlos J. Bernardos](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=sBFY1zkAAAAJ&hl=en).

My interests broadly span machine learning, communication systems and robotics. In the past I worked on 5G-enabled network robots, semantic orchestration, ML assisted robot remote control, DLT federation for networked robotics and network sensing for SLAM. I particularly enjoy building real prototypes and carrying out experimental performance evaluations of networked-robotics and communication systems.
