In recent years we have witnessed the uprising of location-based applications which depend on the device's capabilities to accurately obtain position. IEEE 802.11, foretelling the need for such applications, started the IEEE 802.11az work on next generation positioning. Although this standard provides positioning enhancements for sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands, high accuracy on the order of centimeters can only be obtained in the latter band thanks to the high temporal resolution from the multi-GHz bandwidth. This work presents new techniques provided by IEEE 802.11az for enhanced secured positioning in the mmWave band. Additionally, this article assesses 802.11az mmWave accuracy using a novel trigonometry solution, compares it with advanced positioning solutions, and identifies open research challenges.
