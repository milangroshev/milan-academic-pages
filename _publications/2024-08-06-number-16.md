Over the last two centuries, several industrial revolutions have been witnessed. The first industrial revolution introduced the use of steam power and the mechanization of production, marking the transition from handmade production methods to machines, machines started to play a paramount role in many industrial environments. The first industrial revolution was followed by the second and third revolutions which, respectively, introduced the use of electricity and the mass production of goods, and incorporated the use of computers and automation in industrial processes. The fourth industrial revolution, commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, is currently underway and puts together Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Notwithstanding, the next revolution has already begun, focusing on how to bring back the human presence to achieve human-robot interaction, collaboration, and long-term sustainability within industrial environments.
