This demonstration presents FoReCo, a solution to recover lost control commands in remotely controlled robots. In the demonstration, visitors use a joystick to remotely control a robotic arm under the presence of packet losses in the wireless medium. The lost control commands result in a distorted trajectory of the robotic arm, thus, we deploy FoReCo to recover lost control commands using an ML model that we train with a real-world dataset. The demonstration shows how FoReCo recovers the lost commands, and how the robot arm operates smoothly despite the losses that are present in the wireless medium.
