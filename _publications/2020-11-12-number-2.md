The concept of federation in 5G and NFV networks aims to provide orchestration of services across multiple administrative domains. Edge robotics, as a field of robotics, implements the robot control on the network edge by relying on low-latency and reliable access connectivity. In this paper, we propose a solution that enables Edge robotics service to expand its service footprint or access coverage over multiple administrative domains. We propose application of Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) for the federation procedures to enable private, secure and trusty interactions between undisclosed administrative domains. The solution is applied on a real-case Edge robotics experimental scenario. The results show that it takes around 19 seconds to deploy & federate a Edge robotics service in an external/anonymous domain without any service down-time.
