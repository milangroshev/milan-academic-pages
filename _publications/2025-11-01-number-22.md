Edge computing brings computation near end users, enabling the provisioning of novel use cases. To satisfy end-user requirements, the concept of edge federation has recently emerged as a key mechanism for dynamic resources and services sharing across edge systems managed by different administrative domains. However, existing federation solutions often rely on pre-established agreements and face significant limitations, including operational complexity, delays caused by manual operations, high overhead costs, and dependence on trusted third parties. In this context, blockchain can create dynamic federation agreements that enable service providers to securely interact and share services without prior trust.
This article first describes the problem of edge federation, using the standardized ETSI multi-access edge computing framework as a reference architecture, and how it is being addressed. Then, it proposes a novel solution using blockchain and smart contracts to enable distributed MEC systems to dynamically negotiate and execute federation in a secure, automated, and scalable manner. We validate our framework's feasibility through a performance evaluation using a private Ethereum blockchain, built on the open-source Hyperledger Besu platform. The testbed includes a large number of MEC systems and compares two blockchain consensus algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution automates the entire federation lifecycle-from negotiation to deployment-with a quantifiable overhead, achieving federation in approximately 18 seconds in a baseline scenario. The framework scales efficiently in concurrent request scenarios, where multiple MEC systems initiate federation requests simultaneously. This approach provides a promising direction for addressing the complexities of dynamic, multi-domain federations across the edge-to-cloud continuum.
